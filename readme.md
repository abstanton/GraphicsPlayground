# Graphics Playground
This is a WIP personal project started with the goal to learn real-time graphics programming
and improve my C++ along the way.

## Current Progress
- GPU abstraction
- Texture, Shader, Mesh loading
- Entity Component System 
- Materal system for abstracting shader inputs
- PBR shading with shadow maps for directional lights
- Point lights
- Texture tiling

## Skills Learnt
- OpenGL programming
- PBR Theory
- Modern C++ features

## TODO
- [ ] Support shadow mapping for point lights
- [ ] Improve input support
- [ ] Support transparent materials
- [ ] Image Based Lighting
- [ ] Screen Space Effects (AO, SSR etc)
- [ ] Improve building experience
- [ ] Make prettier demo

## Building
As one of the Todos says, this will not build on other systems because I have included paths on my machine in the CMakeLists.txt. Hopefully I'll fix that
